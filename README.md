# Youtube Challenge - Python
My implentation of the Google Coding Challenge at Bright Internship UK 2021 using Python3

## The Challenge
The instructions for the challenge are included in the included pdf file entitled "Google Coding Challenge".
The pdf document also includes links to the original repository for the challenge, as well as readme files on how to run and test the project.

## Project Status

As of 01/07/2021, Part 1 of the challenge (see included pdf file) has been completed, which includes the following commands:
* NUMBER_OF_VIDEOS
* SHOW_ALL_VIDEOS
* PLAY <video_id>
* STOP
* PLAY_RANDOM
* PAUSE
* CONTINUE
* SHOW_PLAYING

The code inside the function for each of the above commands (except NUMBER_OF_VIDEOS) was written by me and can be found in "src/video_player.py".
